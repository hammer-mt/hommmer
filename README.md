# hommmer

A simple Marketing Mix Modeling library in Python

## About

Most Marketing Mix Models (MMM) are built in Excel, because that's simpler than running a script. But there are things you can't do in Excel, like building 1,130 models to see which one works best, automating repetitive data cleaning tasks, or saving you time manually formatting charts.

However most coding libraries are built for academic scientists, not marketing operators for which MMM is just one of many jobs on the todo list. The `hommmer` library is designed to be as simple as possible, while taking advantage of the power of Python.

This library is opinionated, always guessing at the best default to make things simpler. The goal isn't to build the most advanced model, but to make reasonable decisions that won't get you into trouble. Over-simplifying things will probably annoy the statisticians (Doh!), but it sure makes the work a lot easier.
