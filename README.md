# hommmer

A simple Marketing Mix Modeling library in Python

## about

Most Marketing Mix Models (MMM) are built in Excel, because it's simpler than running a script. But there are things you can't easily do in Excel, like testing 1,130 models to see which one works best. Hommmer is designed to be as simple as possible, while taking advantage of the power of Python. We'll probably annoy the statisticians by over-simplifying things (D'oh!), but we hope you like the results.
