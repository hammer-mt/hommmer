# hommmer

A simple Marketing Mix Modeling library in Python

## about

Most Marketing Mix Models (MMM) are built in Excel, because that's simpler than running a script. But there are things you can't do in Excel, like trying 1,130 models to see which one works best. `hommmer` is designed to be as simple as possible, while taking advantage of the power of Python. This library is opinionated, always guessing at the best default to make things simpler. Over-simplifying things will probably annoy the statisticians (Doh!), but it sure makes the work a lot easier.
