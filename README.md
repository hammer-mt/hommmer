# hommmer

A simple Marketing Mix Modeling library in Python

## About

Most Marketing Mix Models (MMM) are built in Excel, because that's simpler than running a script. But there are things you can't do in Excel, like trying 1,130 models to see which one works best. The `hommmer` library is designed to be as simple as possible, while taking advantage of the power of Python. This library is opinionated, always guessing at the best default to make things simpler. Over-simplifying things will probably annoy the statisticians (Doh!), but it sure makes the work a lot easier.
